Saphirion's Rebol related documentation

We are going to push some of our stuff to Github.
This is intended so that people from the community can use and enhance our stuff and submit pull-requests to us.
Those pull-requests will be reviewed by the Saphirion team, and if accepted, the changes are merged into our main line.

So, it will be included in our next offical release and published via our web-site (http://development.saphirion.com)

The first thing we start with will be a bunch of documentation files. All written in MDP (make-doc-pro) format.
These are the files, from which the documentations on our web-site are dynamically generated.

The structure for documentation is:
documentation/    = stuff that works on R2 and R3
documentation/r2	= stuff for R2
documentation/r3	= stuff for R3
