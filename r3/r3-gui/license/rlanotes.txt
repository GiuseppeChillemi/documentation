Brian Hawley's RLA notes

There were some problems in 6, when combined with 8 and 9. 8 and 9 also violate the "open source" definition, and thus the trademark.

"MEMBERS transfer all rights, including all international copyrights and proprietary rights, to RT under the same terms of this agreement." needs to be more of a license than a transferral, explicitly not taking rights away from the original authors. And 8 and 9 need to refer to the LIBRARY and EXECUTABLE but not the SOURCE.

8 and 9 could be left as-is if the definition of SOFTWARE above had the word SOURCE removed from it.

Note that if 6 is changed to a contribution license, 1 needs to be changed to match.
