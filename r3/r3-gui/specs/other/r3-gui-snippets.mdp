===Introduction
This document is a collection of how-tos, tipps & tricks, snippets that helps to get started with R3-GUI. As soon as the concepts and descriptions here get to big, the information is seperated into its own document.

===Actors & Re-Actors
view [button "test" on-key [do [print mold value]]]

===Triggers
You can use custom triggers in R3-GUI. Example of custom trigger:

	view [
		when [my-trigger] do [print "my trigger has been called"]
		button "run my trigger" do [
			if win: window-face? face [
				do-triggers win 'my-trigger
			]
		]
	]

===Showing layouts

---How to do a layout but don't show
Couple of posibilities:
#use VIEW/NO-WAIT and later than DO-EVENTS
#use WHEN with triggers like:
	view [
		button
		...
		when [enter] do [print "layout has been created"]
	]
#use MAKE-FACE like:
	lay: [button ...]
	layout: make-face 'window reduce/no-set [content: lay]
	view layout
